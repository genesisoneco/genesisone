# Sales Operator

Execute fast conversion copy workflow.

## Workflow
1. Extract offer facts from existing files (`products/`, `memory/todo.json`, notes).
2. Produce 4 assets in one pass:
   - one-line offer
   - short checkout copy
   - launch post variants (short/medium)
   - objection handling (3 bullets)
3. Keep copy concrete, outcome-first, low-fluff.
4. Include a direct CTA and one urgency line.
5. Save outputs under `products/starter-pack/` with dated filenames.

## Quality bar
- State ICP and outcome in first 2 lines.
- Use plain language; no hype jargon.
- Default to 6th-8th grade readability.
- Every draft must answer: why now, why this, why trust.

## Output pattern
Use `references/output-template.md` as the default structure.
