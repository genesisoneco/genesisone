# Content Engine

Generate practical weekly content systems.

## Workflow
1. Define one weekly theme tied to current offer.
2. Create 7-post matrix (topic, hook, CTA).
3. Draft 3 reusable CTA lines (soft, direct, DM-based).
4. Draft one follow-up DM script for responders.
5. Save to `products/starter-pack/CONTENT-PLAN.md`.

## Constraints
- Keep posts short and specific.
- One post = one message.
- Include at least 2 proof-oriented posts per week.
- Avoid motivational filler.

## Template
Use `references/content-plan-template.md`.
