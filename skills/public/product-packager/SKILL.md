# Product Packager

Turn raw materials into a shippable product artifact.

## Workflow
1. Audit available assets (`products/`, `business/`, notes).
2. Define product frame: audience, outcome, format, delivery.
3. Assemble deliverables list (MVP first, optional upgrades second).
4. Draft listing copy and publish checklist.
5. Create/refresh package manifest file in product folder.

## Rules
- Prefer MVP scope that ships same day.
- Keep first version <= 5 deliverables.
- Include version label and changelog note.

## Required output files
- `MVP-LISTING.md`
- `PACKAGE-MANIFEST.md`
- `PUBLISH-CHECKLIST.md`
